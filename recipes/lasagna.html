    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Most store-bought ricotta is terrible. Look for a brand like Calabro, which contains nothing more than milk, salt, and either an acid or starter. If quality ricotta is unavailable, substitute cottage cheese instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons butter, divided
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely minced (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>6 medium garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pounds fresh flat or curly spinach leaves, washed and dried</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the Spinach</strong>: Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add shallots and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add a few large handfuls of spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted. Continue adding spinach a handful at a time until it is all in the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until spinach expels its moisture and most of that moisture evaporates, leaving a dry bottom as you stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Transfer spinach to a fine mesh strainer set over the sink and press out excess moisture with a rubber spatula. Let spinach continue to drain as you prepare the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Ricotta</strong>: Transfer half of the ricotta, both eggs, the Parmesan, and the nutmeg to the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Process until completely smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a large bowl but do not wipe out food processor. Transfer spinach to food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add spinach and remaining ricotta to the ricotta mixture and fold gently to combine.</li>
    </ol>
