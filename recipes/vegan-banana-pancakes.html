        <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>¼ tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for cooking</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mash the banana in a mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and oil. Add the flour and baking powder and mix thoroughly. Make a well in the centre and gradually whisk in the milk. The batter should be a thick, droppable consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of the batter to make American-style pancakes. You will be able to make about 4-5 at a time. Fry on each side for 2-3 mins until golden. Serve with syrup, sliced banana and berries, if you like.</li>
